# Contributing to Bump

Thank you for your interest in contributing to bump! This document covers building,
testing, and the project layout. For usage examples, see the [Workflow Guide](WORKFLOW.md)
and [Configuration Reference](CONFIGURATION.md).

## Build from Source

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable toolchain)
- For static Linux binaries only: `rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`

### Building

Default release build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/launchfirestorm/bump.git
cd bump
cargo build --release
# binary: target/release/bump
```

Optional static Linux build with musl:

```bash
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
# binary: target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/bump
```

### Development Build

For faster iteration during development:

```bash
cargo build
# binary: target/debug/bump
```

Integration tests require a release build (see below).

### Running Tests

Integration tests live in `tests/output.sh`. They exercise `bump print` output across
SemVer phase and formal bumps, CalVer calendar bumps, and all `[label].position` values.

```bash
cargo build --release
./tests/output.sh
```

When testing a cross-compiled binary, set `BUMP_BIN` to the built artifact path:

```bash
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
BUMP_BIN=target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/bump ./tests/output.sh
```

The script reinitializes `bump.toml` in the repository root via `bump init`; any local
changes to that file are overwritten.

CI runs `./tests/output.sh` on native (non-cross-compiled) Linux and macOS jobs after
`cargo build --release --target <triple>`, with `BUMP_BIN` set to
`target/<triple>/release/bump`.
